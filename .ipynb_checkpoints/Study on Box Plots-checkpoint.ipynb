    "\n",
    "This repository has been created as apart of my coursework in Data Analytics. The subject of this repository is a study on Box Plots. <br>\n",
    "It is my intention to use this repository to investigate all aspects of the Box Plot using the available functions within Jupyter. <br>\n",
    "The Box Plot is a popular and simple way of representing statistical data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Summarise the history of the box plot and situations in which its used\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1969, mathematician John W. Tukey introduced the box plot which over time has seen other variations being stemmed from it. <br>\n",
    "*Two of the most common are variable width box plots and notched box plots*\n",
    "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot]\n",

    "-----------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstrate the use of the box plot using data of your choosing\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain any relevant terminology such as terms quartile and percentile\n",
    "#### Upper Extreme (Maximum)\n",
    "#### Upper Quartile (75th Percentile)\n",
    "#### Median\n",
    "#### Lower Quartile (25th Percentile)\n",
    "#### Whisker\n",
    "#### Lower Extreme (Minimum)\n",
    "#### Outlier / single data point\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots are a popular visual representation for comparing distributions between several groups or sets of data as they take up less space making it easier to visually analyse. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot]\n",
